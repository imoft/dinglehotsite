                <p>The idea behind what is the European Union started almost 500 years ago in Dingle. It gives us a perspective beyond current politics. How can we create a branding platform for the Dingle Peninsula embedded with that heritage?The Treaty
                    of Dingle from 1529 sets an opportunity to explore the influence and diaspora of the Irish culture unique to the Peninsula. By activating the path up to 2029 with shared stories and cultural initiatives, this is a fresh new take on
                    heritage and identity to foster new connections. We are of Dingle.</p>

                    shared interests?&nbsp;How to develop a regional identity through proactive interaction with our planet? </p>

It can range from crowdfunding to local
                    movements to activate the right stakeholders. </h5><i class="la la-arrow-down align-self-center top-break" style="font-size: 42px;"></i></div>
